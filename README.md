# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Rock paper scissors project for theodinproject.

This will be played from the browser console for now, but will have a proper GUI in the future. The goal of this project is to create a simple rock paper scissors game where the player plays against a program.

The program will be coded in JS with a bit of HTML to make the webpage.

Link to the original github page of the project (without the GUI) by theodinproject is [here](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/foundations/javascript_basics/project_rock_paper_scissors.md).
