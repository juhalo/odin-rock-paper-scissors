# odin-rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissors project for theodinproject.

This will be played from the browser console for now, but will have a proper GUI in the future. The goal of this project is to create a simple rock paper scissors game where the player plays against a program.

The program will be coded in JS with a bit of HTML to make the webpage.
